# MaxWM
**"Maximum windows. Minimum sanity."**

MaxWM is a small (and slightly cursed) tiling window manager written for X11.
It’s my own experiment in controlling windows *my way* — lightweight, fun, and probably broken in exciting new ways.

---

## ⚙️ Got
These things *actually* work (somehow):
- Picom support (kinda finicky but hey, it breathes)
- Window borders :D
- Moving windows around like a boss
- `feh` for backgrounds (because Nitrogen vanished from the repo, like my will to debug)

---

## 🚫 Don’t Got
Still missing / too lazy to add (for now):
- Workspaces (coming soon-ish?)
- Wayland support (ew, no)
- Rofi
- Kitty
- Animations (you want eye candy? get KDE ;3)

---

## 🧠 Will Add
Plans for world domination:
- Workspaces (and if that works, scratchpad too :>)
- **maxcom** — a customized compositor tuned just for MaxWM

---

## 🙅‍♂️ Won’t Add
Some things are sacred:
- Wayland support (because f*** you ;3)

---

## 🔧 Will Fix
Stuff that *should* work but doesn’t:
- Rofi (refuses to start, probably mad at X11)
- Kitty (same issue, maybe — maybe not ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯)
